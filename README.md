# The Long Road Home

## Gameplay

Press space to move the character. Releasing space stops the character from moving.

## Time Taken
I spent around 30 minutes planning, 4 hours developing, and 30 minutes testing and finishing up. 

## Difficult parts
The most difficult part for me was implementing different camera angles as in the past I have used very simple cameras in Unity that are simply attached to the 'Player' game object for example.

## The parts you think you could do better and how
If I had more time I could have added more Obstacle types as the ones I have are very simplistic, now that the architecture is in place I could easily develop more of these. I also think the navigation of the player could be improved as currently the NavMeshAgent does not move as smoothly as I would like.

## What you would do if you could go a step further on this game
I would add graphics and animations to make the game more interesting, as currently I have only implemented a very simple version to get the mechanics correct. I would also add some sort of pick-ups system to give the character different abilities, for example a jump functionality.

## What did you think
Overall I enjoyed the challenge and making different types of obstacles was the most fun for me. I have definitely realised the areas I need to improve in Unity, for example the NavMesh system and cameras.

## Any comment you may have
I enjoyed the experience and am looking forward to the opportunity to explore games of this type.
